*Question 1 – Text Encryption and Decryption*                                                                     
What This Program Does

1.Reads text from raw_text.txt                                                                 
2.Encrypts the text using user-defined rules                                                           
3.Saves encrypted text to encrypted_text.txt                                                     
4.Decrypts the text back to decrypted_text.txt                                     
5.Checks if the decrypted text matches the original                                                    

How It Works                                                          
1.User enters two numbers: shift1 and shift2                                                           
2.Letters are shifted differently based on:                                                                       
3.Uppercase or lowercase                                                      
4.Position in the alphabet                                                     
5.Numbers, spaces, and symbols are not changed
